    "## Introduction\n",
    "> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. It comes from Prosper, an institution that introduced U.S. consumers to an innovative new approach to personal finance called peer-to-peer lending. Almost twenty years later, Prosper has helped over 1.7 million customers achieve financial well-being through a comprehensive suite of products.\n",

    "### Structure of Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are 81 features, and 113,937 loan entries!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main feature(s) of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CreditGrade & ProsperRating (numeric/Alpha)**: These ratings are crucial for assessing the credit risk associated with each loan. CreditGrade is applicable for listings pre-2009, while ProsperRating is for loans originated after July 2009. Analyzing these ratings can help in understanding the risk profile of the borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LoanStatus**: Indicates the current status of the loan, which is vital for analyzing loan performance, identifying patterns in loan defaults, or early repayments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BorrowerAPR & BorrowerRate**: These provide insights into the cost of borrowing. Analyzing APR and rates in conjunction with credit ratings and loan performance could reveal trends and borrower sensitivity to interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **EstimatedLoss, EstimatedEffectiveYield, EstimatedReturn**: Applicable for loans originated after July 2009, these estimates are crucial for assessing the expected performance of loans, allowing for a risk-return analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ProsperScore**: A custom risk score could be a strong indicator of the probability of a loan defaulting. Analyzing how ProsperScore correlates with loan performance and ProsperRatings could uncover additional insights into risk assessment accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DebtToIncomeRatio**: This is an important measure of a borrower's financial stability and capacity to repay the loan. High ratios may indicate higher risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **LoanOriginalAmount & LoanOriginationDate**: Analyzing the amount of the loan along with the origination date can help in understanding lending trends over time and the average loan size per certain months or years, which could uncover some interesting consumer behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ListingCategory**: The purpose of the loan might influence its risk profile and repayment behavior. For instance, loans for debt consolidation might have different performance characteristics than loans for home improvement as they vary in amount and time needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **EmploymentStatus & StatedMonthlyIncome**: These variables offer insight into the borrower's job stability and income level, which are critical for assessing their ability to repay the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **CurrentDelinquencies & DelinquenciesLast7Years**: These are indicators of past financial behavior which could predict future loan performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Investors**: The number of investors that funded the loan might indicate the level of confidence in the borrower's ability to repay, and could influence other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **LP_GrossPrincipalLoss, LP_NetPrincipalLoss**: These are pivotal for understanding the actual loss experienced due to loan defaults."
